This was a two week group project at Turing School of Software & Design, where we used a movie database API to display now playing movies using React, Router, and Redux. This application fetches from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to display the information. A user has the ability to login, or create an account. Once an account is created the user has the ability to favorite and delete favorited movies.
